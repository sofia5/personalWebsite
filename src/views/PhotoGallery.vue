        <p class="photoIntro">I took a photo course at the age of 14. Thereafter, me and my friends started to have photoshoots, and I spent hours on editing the photos. Today, it's one of my longest withheld interests. 
            <br> My current camera is a Canon 70D, and my top three motives are Nature, Animals and People. </p>
